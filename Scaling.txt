Vertical Scaling vs Horizontal Scaling
1. Load balacing Required                              | Load Balancing not Required.
2. Resilient - If one fails then also others will work | Not Resilient - Single point of failure.
3. Slow - uses network calls, hence slower             | Fast - Inter process communication.
4. Data Inconsistent issue                             | Data Consistent
5. Scales well as user increase                        | Hardware Limit.
